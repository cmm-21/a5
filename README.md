## Hand-in

Once you complete this assignment you should hand in
- a short video demonstrating your baseline (Ex.1 ~ Ex.3) implementation. (**filename: demo1.mp4**)
- a short video demonstrating Ex.5 implementation. (**filename: demo2.mp4**)
- unit tests all passed (automatically checked by GitHub.)
- code pushed to your github repository. 
    
The grading scheme is as follows
- baseline (80 %): based on your code and demo video. Each exercise is counted as 20%.
- advanced (20 %): based on your code and demo video. 

Please leave your questions on GitHub, so your colleagues also can join our discussions. 

## Exercises

Okay now let's do this step-by-step :)

TODO: coordinate frame and collision rendering

### Ex.1 Numerical Integration (baseline - 40%)

### Ex.2-1 Fixed Spring (baseline - 10%)

default length

### Ex.2-2 Spring Attaching Rigid Bodies (baseline - 10%)

default length

### Ex.3 Stable Simulation (baseline - 20%)

DO NOT ERASE YOUR EX.1 IMPLEMENTATION!! 

### Ex.4 Impulse-based Contacts (advanced - 20%)

We want to simulate frictional and restitutional contact.

Your goal ...

## Final Note

You created a rigid body simulator!
